IDEA: Chrome extension that will analyze products on Amazon, gives information on company and manufacturing process and rates them on a scale from 1 to 5 based on their environmental sustainability. 
- How can we incentivize sustainable habits?
- How can we spread awareness about sustainability?
- How can we monitor our own habits/behaviors?
- How can we encourage behaviors with concrete impact, not “greenwashing”?

**Scalability**
*Does the product reach a wide variety of people?*

**Innovation**

**Feasibility**
*Can the product be implemented and understood easily?*

**Technicality**
*Is there some semblance of a finished product?*

**Delivery**
*How effectively can you communicate the problem and the solution?*
