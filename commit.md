# Proof of Concept for Upcycler
An app that utilizes *computer vision* to identify user-inputted objects, and recommend ways to **upcycle and recycle** them.

## Business model
1. _Non-identifiable_, user analytics sold to companies to increase **sustainability** of their products
2. Revenue sourced from *advertisments*
3. Partnerships with **non-profit, academic, and private organizations** to raise funding

## Development

Currently, development is paused for this project. We aim to continue development once a framework is established. App functionality will be primarily written in *React Native*, with **computer vision** code being written using *OpenCV*.

## Goals, and the future
Our dream for *Upcycler* is to provide an **easy-to-use, accessible, and convenient** way for people to make use of what is around them. We hope that with this project we can contribute to sustainability by making things like **upcycling and recycling** less obscure to a larger amount of people. 

*In a society that grows more plastic by the day, we believe that our app will not only make sustainability more accessible, but more achievable.*
