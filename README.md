IDEA: Web-app that allows user to submit receipts (physical or digital), identifies manufacturers of the product, returns a rating from 1 to 5 based on the environmental sustainability of their business practices, and gives a badge/point/achievement to the user's profile if that purchase was sustainable. 
- How can we incentivize sustainable habits?
- How can we spread awareness about sustainability?
- How can we monitor our own habits/behaviors?
- How can we encourage behaviors with concrete impact, not “greenwashing”?
